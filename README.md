TESTED ON FIREFOX ONLY. I can not guarrantee that it will work on other browsers. If if works on Chromium by default, that's great. If not, I can make it work in the future.

If you wish to install it, there are two ways of going about that:
- This is the easiest. Simply go to this link: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/youtube-music-autoloop/ and install it as normal.
- The harder way:
1. Download the repo as a .zip
2. Go to about:addons in your browser, or just go to your extension menu
3. Click the settings icon and select "Install Add-on from file", then select the .zip, and install.
